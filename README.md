Hi, I'm Nia — a curious soul with a management background and a soft spot for design, editing, and code.
I love learning new things, finding beauty in visuals, and turning ideas into something creative (especially with digital tools, since drawing isn't my thing). 
Big fan of art and nature, mild chocolate, and cool weather — not necessarily in that order!
