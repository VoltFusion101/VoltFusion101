Motivated and adaptable individual with a background in management and basic accounting. <br/>
Currently expanding expertise in programming, editing and design,<br/>
with a passion for continuous learning and skill development.<br/>
I have a keen eye for beauty and love editing to enhance visuals.<br/>
I enjoy seeing and working with art and nature.<br/>
While I can't draw, I prefer to work with computers to create something beautiful through digital tools and design.<br/>
I love chocolate—but not when it’s too sweet—and I can’t stand hot weather!
